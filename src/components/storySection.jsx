        Yea, that's my name (up), and I am a Nigeria-based developer. So curious
        about how designs are made, I learnt graphic design some 6 years ago. I
        understood the design theories and other aspect of designs. The design
        space further led me into web development. Started writing HTML codes
        and some inline CSS styling on a small tablet that I owned. Got a
        personal computer and it hastened my development process ! Let me spare
        you the details. I got familiar with youtube and other online resources
        and I was able to get my self the accurate tech stack that I can. I
        advanced my HTML and CSS skills and did same to my JS path. I learnt and
        I'm learning React and curiosity again led me to learn little about
        React Native (a branch to Mobile Development). I have left mobile
        development for a while and I decided to horn my React skills and apply
        for jobs.
